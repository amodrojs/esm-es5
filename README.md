## todo

* replace identifiers for simulateCycle option.
* option around define() wrapping.
* hack in support for a module meta? `import { require, normalize } from module`?

---

No `export *` support. May be added later. Instead, use named exports for clearer expression of intention, split exports into separate files for better granular consumption.
